## Topics & Quranic Perspective

### **1. Patience (Sabr)**
Patience is a central virtue in Islam. The Quran repeatedly emphasizes that **Allah is with those who remain steadfast** during hardships and tests. It encourages believers to rely on patience and prayer as a means of overcoming struggles.

### **2. Seeking Forgiveness (Istighfar)**
The Quran teaches that **Allah’s mercy is limitless** and that no sin is too great to be forgiven if one sincerely repents. Verses about seeking forgiveness stress humility, reflection, and returning to Allah with sincerity.

### **3. Hope and Relief from Hardship**
Islam reassures that **hardship is always followed by ease** and that Allah never burdens a soul beyond its capacity. Believers are encouraged to maintain faith, knowing that difficulties come with divine wisdom.

### **4. Gratitude (Shukr)**
Gratitude is emphasized as a way to **increase blessings**. The Quran teaches that acknowledging and appreciating Allah’s favors leads to greater rewards, while ingratitude can result in deprivation.

### **5. Justice and Fairness (‘Adl)**
Justice is one of Islam’s fundamental principles. The Quran commands believers to uphold justice **even if it goes against personal interests**, ensuring fairness and equity in all aspects of life.

## Importance of Accurate Retrieval
When retrieving Quranic verses, **accuracy is critical**. Verses should always be presented **with proper references**, and AI responses must be aligned with **authentic interpretations** to ensure meaningful and respectful engagement.
